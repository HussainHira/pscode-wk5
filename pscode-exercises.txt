// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
a = 2 
b= 10 
sum of the a + b is 10


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
# check if a number is even or odd 
a = 2 
b = 10 
if a + b equal to even  
Print ("Even")
else: 
Print ("Odd") 




// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 
  userinputs: [5 random different numbers]   
  number: 5 
  number: 7 
  number: 8 
  number: 19 
  number: 20 

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers. 
Numbers: [5, + 7, + 8, + 19, + 20] 
sum of the number: 59 
Average of the five number: 59/5 = 12  

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers. 
   # find the minimum and maximum of the five entered numbers   
    if find the minimum number:
    print("minimum number")
    if find the maximum number
    print ("maximum number")
    else:
    print("not found")

     
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
5 different random numberes were combined from users.
performed addition of those random numbers.
average them out of by dividing by the total of five numbers.

in step c starting from hash to indicate what we are going to find.
wrote conditional requirement if met then desire answer.
